## Overview

Drafts chapters following established world-building, character designs, and style guidelines while maintaining continuity with previous chapters.

**Triggers:** "write chapter", "draft next scene", "continue story", "write scene", "draft chapter"

## Output Language

All generated novel content MUST be output in the language specified by the user via the `{{OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}}` variable.

- **Variable:** `{{OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}}`
- **Default:** `English`
- **Supported:** Any language the underlying LLM supports
- **Scope:** Applies to all generated narrative content, NOT to Skill infrastructure files
- **Infrastructure files** (SKILL.md, references/, module definitions) remain in English to ensure cross-tool compatibility

See [Section 0.3 of README FOR AI](../../README%20FOR%20AI.md#03-runtime-output-language-single-authority) for the authoritative declaration.

## Quick Start

1. Load the chapter-writing sub-skill and review the reference templates in method-patterns-chapter.md
2. Review world-building documents and character sheets for context
3. Draft chapters following scene structure, POV rules, and pacing formulas
4. Save chapter files following the naming conventions (ch-{number}-{title}.md)
5. Update continuity state files via the continuity-tracker module after each chapter

## Related Modules

This module is a peer of the following modules. It may hand off to them, but it does not own or invoke them (spec Section 5.1: each module is independently usable, with a single responsibility and no circular dependencies):

| Skill | Purpose | Path |
|-------|---------|------|
| novel-worldbuilding | Generates and maintains world-building documents for novel serialization projects. Covers magic systems, geography, politics, technology, history, and culture design. | [SKILL.md](../worldbuilding/SKILL.md) |
| novel-character-design | Generates and maintains character sheets including identity, psychology, arc, relationships, and voice profiles for novel characters. | [SKILL.md](../character-design/SKILL.md) |
| novel-continuity-check | Verifies consistency across all chapters and state files, identifying plot holes, timeline errors, and character inconsistency. | [SKILL.md](../continuity-check/SKILL.md) |
| novel-publishing-workflow | Manages Git-based publishing pipeline for serialized chapters including tagging, release notes, and automated verification. | [SKILL.md](../publishing-workflow/SKILL.md) |
| novel-continuity-tracker | Maintains persistent state files including timeline, character states, location states, and unresolved thread ledger for cross-session state management. | [SKILL.md](../continuity-tracker/SKILL.md) |

## Examples

- [example-chapter-draft.md](../../references/examples/example-chapter-draft.md) - Worked example demonstrating this module's patterns

## Quick Reference: File Conventions

- **Naming:** Chapter files use the convention `ch-{number}-{title}.md` (e.g. `ch-001-the-beginning.md`).
- **Continuity header:** Each chapter begins with the YAML frontmatter block defined in
  [method-patterns-publishing.md](../../references/method-patterns-publishing.md) Section 3
  (`chapter`, `title`, `pov`, `date`, `word_count`, `status`, `license`), immediately followed by
  the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license header. This frontmatter is what the continuity tracker reads to
  reconcile the chapter against `state/` files.
- **Encoding:** UTF-8
- **Line endings:** LF (Unix-style)
- **Max file size:** 500 lines (split if exceeded)

## Verification Gates

Before considering this module's output complete, verify:

1. [ ] Chapter follows established POV rules (no head-hopping)
2. [ ] Timeline events are chronologically consistent with previous chapters
3. [ ] Character voices match their established voice profiles
4. [ ] Scene structure follows the pacing formula (scene -> sequel)
5. [ ] Foreshadowing references are set up before payoff
6. [ ] No continuity violations with world-building documents
7. [ ] Dialogue formatting follows the established style guide

## Constraints & Boundaries

### Hard Rules

- All generated content MUST be output in `{{OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}}` (default: English)
- Infrastructure and metadata remain in English
- SKILL.md is index + quick-reference ONLY - no code templates, no long-form methodology
- All code templates, structural patterns, and long-form methodology live in `references/`
- This module file MUST NOT exceed 500 lines
- Every generated novel file MUST carry the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license header block before any narrative content. Where a file also carries YAML frontmatter (mandatory for chapter files — see `references/method-patterns-publishing.md` Section 3), the ordering is: frontmatter at byte 0, then the CC license header, then the narrative.
- State must be persisted in structured files, NOT in conversation context
- Each module has a single responsibility; no circular dependencies between modules

### Scope Boundaries

Scope: Drafts chapters following established world-building, character designs, and style guidelines while maintaining continuity with previous chapters.

This module does NOT handle:
- novel-worldbuilding: Generates and maintains world-building documents for novel serialization projects. Covers magic systems, geography, politics, technology, history, and culture design.
- novel-character-design: Generates and maintains character sheets including identity, psychology, arc, relationships, and voice profiles for novel characters.
- novel-continuity-check: Verifies consistency across all chapters and state files, identifying plot holes, timeline errors, and character inconsistency.
- novel-publishing-workflow: Manages Git-based publishing pipeline for serialized chapters including tagging, release notes, and automated verification.
- novel-continuity-tracker: Maintains persistent state files including timeline, character states, location states, and unresolved thread ledger for cross-session state management.
