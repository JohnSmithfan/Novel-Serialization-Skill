## Overview

Generates and maintains world-building documents for novel serialization projects. Covers magic systems, geography, politics, technology, history, and culture design.

**Triggers:** "build a world", "create setting", "design magic system", "design political system", "create culture"

## Output Language

All generated novel content MUST be output in the language specified by the user via the `{{OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}}` variable.

- **Variable:** `{{OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}}`
- **Default:** `English`
- **Supported:** Any language the underlying LLM supports
- **Scope:** Applies to all generated narrative content, NOT to Skill infrastructure files
- **Infrastructure files** (SKILL.md, references/, module definitions) remain in English to ensure cross-tool compatibility

See [Section 0.3 of README FOR AI](../../README%20FOR%20AI.md#03-runtime-output-language-single-authority) for the authoritative declaration.

## Quick Start

1. Load the worldbuilding sub-skill and review the reference templates in method-patterns-worldbuilding.md
2. Define the core world parameters (genre, era, technology level, tone)
3. Build world components iteratively: magic system -> geography -> politics -> culture -> history
4. Save world-building documents following the naming conventions
5. Update world state in the continuity-tracker module for cross-module consistency

## Related Modules

This module is a peer of the following modules. It may hand off to them, but it does not own or invoke them (spec Section 5.1: each module is independently usable, with a single responsibility and no circular dependencies):

| Skill | Purpose | Path |
|-------|---------|------|
| novel-character-design | Generates and maintains character sheets including identity, psychology, arc, relationships, and voice profiles for novel characters. | [SKILL.md](../character-design/SKILL.md) |
| novel-chapter-writing | Drafts chapters following established world-building, character designs, and style guidelines while maintaining continuity with previous chapters. | [SKILL.md](../chapter-writing/SKILL.md) |
| novel-continuity-check | Verifies consistency across all chapters and state files, identifying plot holes, timeline errors, and character inconsistency. | [SKILL.md](../continuity-check/SKILL.md) |
| novel-publishing-workflow | Manages Git-based publishing pipeline for serialized chapters including tagging, release notes, and automated verification. | [SKILL.md](../publishing-workflow/SKILL.md) |
| novel-continuity-tracker | Maintains persistent state files including timeline, character states, location states, and unresolved thread ledger for cross-session state management. | [SKILL.md](../continuity-tracker/SKILL.md) |

## Examples

- [example-worldbuilding.md](../../references/examples/example-worldbuilding.md) - Worked example demonstrating this module's patterns

## Quick Reference: File Conventions

- **Naming:** World-building documents use kebab-case filenames under `worldbuilding/` — `worldbuilding/{domain}.md` (e.g., `worldbuilding/magic-system.md`), per the root SKILL.md File Conventions. State files are owned by the continuity-tracker module.
- **Encoding:** UTF-8
- **Line endings:** LF (Unix-style)
- **Max file size:** 500 lines (split if exceeded)

## Verification Gates

Before considering this module's output complete, verify:

1. [ ] Magic system rules are internally consistent (no contradictions)
2. [ ] Geography maps to political boundaries logically
3. [ ] Technology level is consistent across cultures
4. [ ] Historical timeline has no anachronisms
5. [ ] Cultural descriptions avoid real-world stereotypes
6. [ ] All named locations have at least one defining feature

## Constraints & Boundaries

### Hard Rules

- All generated content MUST be output in `{{OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}}` (default: English)
- Infrastructure and metadata remain in English
- SKILL.md is index + quick-reference ONLY - no code templates, no long-form methodology
- All code templates, structural patterns, and long-form methodology live in `references/`
- This module file MUST NOT exceed 500 lines
- Every generated novel file MUST carry the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license header block before any narrative content. Where a file also carries YAML frontmatter (mandatory for chapter files — see `references/method-patterns-publishing.md` Section 3), the ordering is: frontmatter at byte 0, then the CC license header, then the narrative.
- State must be persisted in structured files, NOT in conversation context
- Each module has a single responsibility; no circular dependencies between modules

### Scope Boundaries

Scope: Generates and maintains world-building documents for novel serialization projects. Covers magic systems, geography, politics, technology, history, and culture design.

This module does NOT handle:
- novel-character-design: Generates and maintains character sheets including identity, psychology, arc, relationships, and voice profiles for novel characters.
- novel-chapter-writing: Drafts chapters following established world-building, character designs, and style guidelines while maintaining continuity with previous chapters.
- novel-continuity-check: Verifies consistency across all chapters and state files, identifying plot holes, timeline errors, and character inconsistency.
- novel-publishing-workflow: Manages Git-based publishing pipeline for serialized chapters including tagging, release notes, and automated verification.
- novel-continuity-tracker: Maintains persistent state files including timeline, character states, location states, and unresolved thread ledger for cross-session state management.
