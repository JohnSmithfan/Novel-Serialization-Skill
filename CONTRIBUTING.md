### Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch using the naming convention below (`git checkout -b feat/my-feature`)
3. Make your changes following the guidelines below
4. Validate your changes:
   - Check that every `SKILL.md` has valid YAML frontmatter with `name`,
     `description`, `license: GPL-3.0` and `novel_content_license: CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0`
   - Verify every internal cross-reference in the Markdown files resolves to a
     file that exists
   - Confirm no file exceeds the 500-line limit (see [The 500-Line Rule](#the-500-line-rule))

   > There is no automated validation script in this repository yet. These are manual
   > checks; if you want to add tooling for them, see
   > [Suggesting Enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements).
5. Commit your changes using conventional commit format
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feat/my-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

## How To Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the issue list as you might find out
that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please
include as many details as possible:

- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem
- Describe the behavior you observed and what you expected to see
- Include screenshots or animated GIFs if possible
- Include details about your environment (OS, editor, AI tool used)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an
enhancement suggestion, please include:

- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most users
- List some examples of how this enhancement would be used
- Explain why this enhancement wouldn't fit in existing modules

### Submitting Pull Requests

- Ensure your code follows the project's style guidelines
- Ensure the manual validation checks in
  [Development Workflow](#development-workflow) pass
- Update documentation as needed
- Follow the [Git Conventions](#git-conventions) below
- Reference any related issues in your PR description

### Review Process

1. A maintainer triages the PR within 7 days and applies labels.
2. Review is against the checklist in
   [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md), including the
   Harness Compliance and license-compliance confirmations.
3. At least one approving review is required. Changes requested must be addressed in the
   same branch; do not open a replacement PR.
4. Merging is squash-only onto the default branch, and the merge commit message must follow
   the [Commit Message Format](#commit-message-format) below.
5. PRs touching `references/`, `modules/`, or `prompts/` additionally require confirmation
   that all cross-references still resolve and that no file exceeds 500 lines.

## Prompts Directory — Dual-Mode Design Philosophy

The `prompts/` directory contains prompt templates that operate in **dual-mode**:

1. **Human copy-paste mode** (primary): Human users open any prompt file in a text
   editor, copy its entire content, and paste it into any AI chat window
   (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, etc.) to get immediate, structured output.
2. **Agent-assisted mode** (secondary): The modules under `modules/` may refer to the
   *methodology* these prompts encode when orchestrating a workflow. The prompt files
   themselves are **not** invoked directly by an agent — see
   spec Section 4.1 and the anti-pattern table in Section 13 of README FOR AI.md.

**Key rules for prompts/:**
- Files in `prompts/` are **NOT** for agent auto-invocation — they are standalone
  templates designed for human interaction
- Each prompt file must be self-contained and work independently
- The `{{OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}}` placeholder must be present in all prompt templates
  (see Section 0.3 of README FOR AI.md for the authoritative declaration)
- Prompt templates must instruct the AI to include the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license
  header in all generated novel content

## Module Development Guidelines

### The 500-Line Rule

Any file exceeding **500 lines** MUST be split into sub-modules under the same
directory. This is a hard constraint to ensure modularity and maintainability.

When splitting:
1. Create sub-modules with descriptive names (e.g., `method-patterns-worldbuilding.md`)
2. The master file becomes an index pointing to each split module
3. Each sub-module must be independently usable
4. Update the parent index file to reflect the new structure

### Module SKILL.md Structure

Each module under `modules/` must have its own `SKILL.md` with:

- **YAML Frontmatter**: Including `name`, `description`, `license: GPL-3.0`,
  `novel_content_license: CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0`
- **Purpose**: One-line description of what the module does
- **Triggers**: Keywords that activate this module
- **Constraints**: Hard rules the agent must never violate
- **Cross-References**: Pointers to `references/` for templates and patterns

## License Compliance

This project uses a **dual-licensing** model:

| Component | License | Scope |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Skill Infrastructure | GPL-3.0 | Code, templates, prompts, SKILL.md files, GitHub workflows, configuration files |
| Generated Novel Content | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 | Chapters, character sheets, world-building docs produced by the Skill |

**Important rules:**
- Every generated novel file MUST carry the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license header block before any narrative content. Where a file also carries YAML frontmatter (mandatory for chapter files — see `references/method-patterns-publishing.md` Section 3), the ordering is: frontmatter at byte 0, then the CC license header, then the narrative.
- Module SKILL.md files MUST declare both licenses in YAML frontmatter
- Prompt templates MUST instruct the AI to include the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 header
- Do NOT mix license-protected content across license boundaries

## Recognition Policy

Contributions to this project are recognized as follows:

- **CHANGELOG.md** — Substantive changes are recorded under the release
  version in which they land, so the project history stays auditable.
- **Contributors list** — Add your GitHub handle to the **Credits** section of
  `README.md` in the same pull request as your contribution.
- **Commit attribution** — Use the Conventional Commits trailer format so
  authorship survives rebases.
- **Module authorship** — If you add a new module under `modules/`, list
  yourself in that module's `metadata.author` frontmatter field.

Recognition is opt-out: if you would rather not be named publicly, say so in
your pull request description and we will omit your handle while keeping your
Git commit authorship intact.

## Style Guidelines

- **Language**: All infrastructure files (SKILL.md, references/, prompts/, .github/)
  MUST be in English for universal compatibility
- **Markdown**: Use standard Markdown syntax; prefer ATX-style headings (`#`, `##`, etc.)
- **Markdown linting**: Follow the [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)
  default rule set, with these project-specific decisions:
  - Blank line required before every heading, and before and after every fenced code block
    (a heading with no preceding blank line renders as literal text on GitHub)
  - One blank line between list items that contain multiple paragraphs; keep simple lists tight
  - No trailing whitespace in `.md` files — `.editorconfig` sets
    `trim_trailing_whitespace = false` for Markdown, so two-space line breaks are preserved
  - Use relative links for internal references, and percent-encode spaces in filenames
    (e.g. `README%20FOR%20AI.md`), because GitHub truncates a link at a raw space
  - No file exceeds 500 lines (see [The 500-Line Rule](#the-500-line-rule))
- **Code blocks**: Use language identifiers where applicable
- **Tables**: Use Markdown tables for structured data
- **Links**: Use relative links for internal references

## Git Conventions

### Branch Naming

- `feat/<name>` — New features (matches the `feat` Conventional Commit type)
- `fix/<name>` — Bug fixes
- `docs/<name>` — Documentation changes
- `refactor/<name>` — Code refactoring
- `chore/<name>` — Maintenance tasks

### Commit Message Format

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**

```
feat(worldbuilding): add magic system template
fix(chapter-writing): correct scene structure example
docs(contributing): update module development guidelines
```

### Tagging and Releases

- Use semantic versioning: `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
- Tags follow the format: `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, `v1.1.1`, etc.
- Release notes are generated from CHANGELOG.md entries
